# TARAS: Task Automation, Recognition, and Assistance System

## Overview

TARAS is a sophisticated AI assistant system designed to perform advanced tasks such as screen analysis, dynamic agent creation, auditory learning, and real-time interaction. This system leverages state-of-the-art APIs and frameworks to provide a seamless and intelligent user experience.

## System Components

1. **Screen Analysis:** Utilizes Google Cloud Vision API to analyze visual content.
2. **Agent Creation Framework:** Implements dynamic agent creation using SPADE (Smart Python Agent Development Environment).
3. **Auditory Input and Learning:** Processes audio inputs using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
4. **Real-Time Communication:** Enables seamless interaction using WebSockets with FastAPI.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TARAS.git
   cd TARAS
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Google Cloud credentials:

   - Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Vision API and Speech-to-Text API.
   - Download the JSON key file and set the environment variable:
     ```
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/credentials.json"
     ```

5. Install SPADE for the agent framework:
   ```
   pip install spade
   ```

## Running the System

To run the TARAS system:

```
python src/main.py
```

This will start the FastAPI server and initialize all components of the system.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```
pytest tests/
```

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Advanced Visual and Auditory Processing:** Leverages state-of-the-art APIs for accurate input recognition.
- **Dynamic Agent Interaction:** Facilitates communication and decision-making among multiple agents.
- **Real-Time User Interaction:** Provides low-latency communication channels for immediate feedback.

## Deployment

For deployment, consider the following steps:

1. Set up a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
2. Use a production ASGI server like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.
3. Set up proper logging and monitoring.
4. Use environment variables for all sensitive information.

## Maintenance and Scaling Considerations

- Regularly update dependencies and API versions.
- Monitor API usage and costs, especially for Google Cloud services.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- For scaling, consider using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
